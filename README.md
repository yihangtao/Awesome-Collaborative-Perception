# Collaborative-Perception

This repository collects recent advances in **collaborative / cooperative / multi-agent perception** for **V2I / V2V / V2X** autonomous driving. 
Generally, the works are classified into the following types:
- Communication Reduction
- Model Enhancement
- Robustness
- Security
- Others

## Communication Reduction

Reducing the communication burden to save bandwidth resources and mitigate the perception delay is one of the most significant subtopics of collaborative perception.
Recently, many papers have focused on optimizing communication loads of collaborative perception, which are listed in chronological order.

## Model Enhancement

## Robustness

## Security
